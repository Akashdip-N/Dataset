# Mushroom Images Dataset

## Introduction
This folder contains the dataset used in the project. The dataset is a collection of images of different classes of mushrooms.

The dataset is divided into two folders: `train` and `val`.

The `train` folder contains 194 images and the `val` folder contains 28 images and the `test` contains 3 images.

The dataset is divided into 2 classes: `edible` and `poisonous`. Each class contains images of the respective mushrooms. The dataset is used to train a deep learning model to classify the fruits into their respective classes.

## Dataset
The dataset is used for educational purposes only and not for commercial use.

The images for the `train` and `val` folders are collected from [Ultimate Mushroom](https://ultimate-mushroom.com) and the images for the `test` folder are collected from [Mushroom Observer](https://mushroomobserver.org)

The `credits` folder contains information about the author and the copyright of the images.
